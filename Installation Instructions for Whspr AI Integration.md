## Quick Start

The integration includes mock services that work immediately without setting up the AI models. This allows you to:

1. Test the streaming functionality right away
2. Develop and iterate on the frontend
3. Set up the real AI services when ready for production

## API Endpoints Added

- `POST /api/streaming/start` - Start a new streaming session
- `GET /api/streaming/status/:sessionId` - Get session status
- `POST /api/streaming/stop/:sessionId` - Stop a streaming session
- `GET /api/streaming/sessions` - List active sessions
- And 4 more endpoints for complete streaming control

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for troubleshooting
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
3. Verify TypeScript compilation with `npm run check`

The integration preserves all your existing functionality while adding the new AI-powered streaming capabilities.
